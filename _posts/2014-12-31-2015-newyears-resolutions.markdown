It's that time of the year again. Here's what I want to try and accomplish in 2015:

### General stuff

- I'm going to try and [acknowledge my accomplishments](http://ellenbrook.github.io/detroit-web-designer-blog/2014/12/23/creatives-and-impostor-syndrome/)
- I want to read at least 1 book a month. While I think I already accomplish this on average, it's very sporadic and aimless. I'd like to plan my reading a bit more, and be consistent, as opposed to marathon reads then longer periods where I don't read anything at all. (P.S. The [Gutenberg project](http://www.gutenberg.org/) is awesome!)
- Get better at adopting new techniques, languages or frameworks. Recently I've gotten into [Laravel](http://laravel.com/) and [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/) and am loving it. [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) has also earned a special place in my heart. I've realized that I should get better at studying new stuff, even if it _is_ just hype.
- I want to practice my piano skills more often.
- I want to try and [blog daily](http://www.shubhro.com/2014/12/27/software-engineers-should-write/), about anything and everything.

### Specific stuff

- I want to complete the 30 day writing challenge on [Morning Pages](http://morningpages.net)
- I want to launch a personal webdev project every month.
- I want to establish a regular exercise schedule

#### I want to see my son more.

Here's to a great 2015. Happy new years every one!
