Last thing, I've been thinking about for a couple days Eric, since you mentioned that you'd like to freelance.

I think I should tell you about the repercussions, not being demotivating or anything, but here are my experiences:

- You're not a freelance developer. Your new jobtitle is businessman

- If you don't have contacts or a clear market, your first job is to find customers and sell yourself

- Then, when you have a customerbase, besides making their websites you have to, #1 negotiate prices, your customers are likely small business owners as well and will haggle as fuck with you. Not just at first but during and especially after the project, when payment is due.

- If you partner with a salesperson, you partner with someone who's educated and specialized in maximizing profits. You are a big factor on the profit margin. They can be fantastic people, but you really need to keep in mind that this is business, and this is a business contact. They won't hesitate to screw you over and make it seem like its for your best. It's just how sellers are.

One final thing I would mention about my own experience is, that I wish I had not focussed on freelancing, but on making my own business instead. Sites that can pay the rent. Shops, blogs, aggregatos etc. If I could start over I would not freelance, but focus on my own websites. Freelancing is really not freedom as you have customers to catch, keep up with, satisfy, support, upsell, etc.
