_As part of my new years resolutions, I've set about finally learning [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), this is Day 1._

1. Found this very handy [NerdTree cheatsheet](http://www.cheatography.com/stepk/cheat-sheets/vim-nerd). I love the new-found "Shift-c" command
2. Used the [Vim docs](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/syntax.html) to make a [colorscheme](https://gist.github.com/Sakto/23ab3ba791907e0bc325) that's a lot like what I'm used to (placed it in ~/.vim/after/colors/daniels.vim)
3. Learned that I should install ctags and run "ctags -R ." in the project to be able to Ctrl+click to go to the function definition (also add the "tags" file to .gitignore)
4. Gave up after fighting with some indentation issues I couldn't figure out, got frustrated, and had stuff to do. Back on track now!
5. Figured out how to remap Shift+space to the esc key. Awesome!
