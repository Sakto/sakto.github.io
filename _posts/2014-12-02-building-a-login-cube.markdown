My good friend [Eric](http://ericellenbrook.com "Eric Ellenbrook - Detroit based webdeveloper") challenged me to make a login layout with some
fancy animations. I took him up on it, and after brainstorming a bit I found something similar to what I had in mind.

I studied CSS transitions a bit, and inspired by [this example](http://cssdeck.com/labs/css3-flipping-cube), I added some more cubes and some form fields
which resulted in the [cube sign in thingy](http://codepen.io/Sakto/details/EaVbWJ/) - Check the entire pen [here](http://codepen.io/Sakto/pen/EaVbWJ/)
