_As part of my new years resolutions, I've set about finally learning [Vim](http://www.vim.org/), this is Day 8._

I must admit. I almost gave up a couple days ago. The frustration was just too much when I needed to concentrate on work, but had to google even the most basic tasks every
few minutes. And I've sissied out and switched back to my [usual editor](http://www.aptana.com/) a couple times when I just needed to get stuff done.

**But**, I've decided to keep at it.


I've been reading a few [Vim](http://www.viemu.com/a-why-vi-vim.html) [articles](http://blog.joncairns.com/2012/05/using-vim-as-a-php-ide/), and yesterday I was watching
some videos on [Laracast](http://laracast.com), and the speed at which he performs editing tasks is just insane.

_I want that._

I'm starting to get the hang of blending visual mode with command combos. Like selecting everything inside curly braces and commenting/uncommenting or indenting the
entire block with just a few keystrokes.
I've also remapped the : key to - for faster commands (- instead of shift+.), and Q to q and W to w to avoid those annoying case typos.

Ctrl+space I mapped to esc. It's just faster to hit Ctrl+space than hitting the esc key. I mapped the Space key to i so I can just hit space to start typing.

I also found a way [better cheatsheet](http://www.worldtimzone.com/res/vi.html) than those graphical ones that tries to jam as much info in as possible.
It's waay better for a rookie like me.

Oh yeah, and tabs.. They rock
