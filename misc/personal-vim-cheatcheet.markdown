## Personal Vim cheatsheet

Just a few notes to myself while learning [Vim](http://sakto.github.io/vim/editor/learning/new/year/2015/01/08/2015-starting-vim/).

## Copy/Paste/Delete

- Copying: "yy" to copy entire line, ":y[N]" to copy [N] lines below
- Pasting: "Ctrl+r *" to paste something from the clipboard, "p" to paste from the buffer (something you yanked with :y5 for example), "P" to paste before the cursor.
- Deleting: "dd" to delete entire line (like Ctrl+x). Insert mode: "Ctrl+w" to delete previous word (like Ctrl+backspace)

## Navigation

- _Forgot what I was going to put here_

## Windows

- "Ctrl+w c" to close current window

## Misc

- "." to repeat previous action (like paste, or insert some text or whatever)
